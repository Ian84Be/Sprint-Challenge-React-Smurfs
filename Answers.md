1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

Server-side routing is the standard method to navigate a website, changing the url to serve a whole new document to the user. This is good for search engine optimization, but may cause slower load times as the entire page is rendered for every navigation.

Client side routing uses JavaScript to change the state of the web application internally, blocking requests to the server and updating only the necessary parts of the view. Initial load time may be longer, but navigation will be quicker for the user. Requires more effort to develop and implement, and may be problematic for search engines.
